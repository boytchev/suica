# About
[**Suica.js**](https://github.com/boytchev/suica) is a library that allows easy programming
of mobile 3D graphics in JavaScript. The first version of Suica, now archieved, uses directly
WebGL. The second version is based on [Three.js](https://threejs.org). 

Initially Suica is created to support the course *Educational Languages and Environment* for
undergraduate students from the [Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en)
at [Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng).


Suica is licensed under **GPL-3.0**. Latest complete version is **1.0.12** from October 2015.

Three.js and other libraries will be included in this repository to safeguard against incompatibilities
with future versions. They are not a part of Suica, but since version 2 they will be esential for it.
