# Suica
Mobile 3D made simple. As simple, as this ([live demo](https://boytchev.github.io/suica/examples/minimal-example.html)):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<script src="suica.js"></script>

<suica>
    <demo>
    <cube>
</suica>
```

[**Suica.js**](https://github.com/boytchev/suica) is a library that allows easy programming
of mobile 3D graphics in JavaScript. The first version of Suica, now archieved, uses directly
WebGL. The second version is based on [Three.js](https://threejs.org). 

Suica is created to support the course *Educational Languages and Environment* for
undergraduate students from the [Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en)
at [Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng).


Suica is licensed under **GPL-3.0**. Latest complete version is **1.0.12** from October 2015.

Three.js and other libraries are included in this repository to safeguard against incompatibilities
with future versions. They are not a part of Suica.
