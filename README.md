Mobile 3D made simple. As simple, as this ([live demo](https://boytchev.github.io/suica/examples/minimal-example.html)):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<script src="suica.js"></script>

<suica>
    <demo>
    <cube>
</suica>
```

[**Suica.js**](https://github.com/boytchev/suica) is a library that allows easy
programming of mobile 3D graphics in JavaScript. The old version Suica 1.0 used
WebGL. The new Suica 2.0, which is currently **under heavy but rapid development**
is based on [Three.js](https://threejs.org). Suica is created to support the
course *Educational Languages and Environment* for undergraduate students from
the [Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en) at
[Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng).

Suica is licensed under **GPL-3.0**.
