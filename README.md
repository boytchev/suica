Mobile 3D made simple. As simple, as this ([live demo](https://boytchev.github.io/suica/examples/minimal-example.html)):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<script src="suica.js"></script>

<suica>
    <demo>
    <cube>
</suica>
```

[**Suica.js**](https://github.com/boytchev/suica) is a library that allows easy
programming of mobile 3D graphics in JavaScript. The first version of Suica, now
archieved, uses directly WebGL. The second version is based on
[Three.js](https://threejs.org).

Suica is created to support the course *Educational Languages and Environment*
for undergraduate students from the
[Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en) at
[Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng).


Suica is licensed under **GPL-3.0**. Latest complete version is Suica 1.0.12 from
October 2015. The current Suica 2.0 is **under heavy but rapid redevelopment**.

Three.js and other libraries are included in this repository to safeguard against incompatibilities
with future versions. They are not a part of Suica.
