# arc

Command. Adds a circle оr a circular arc to the path.

#### Syntax:
{: .lh-0 .mb-0 pb-0 }
```
HTML:
<arc center="𝑥,𝑦" radius="𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑢𝑠" from="𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚" to="𝑡𝑜" cw="𝑐𝑤">

JS:
var a = 𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑔.arc( 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑢𝑠, 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚, 𝑡𝑜, 𝑐𝑤 );
```
{: .lh-0 }


The `arc` command creates an arc from a circle with center (`x`,`y`) and given
`radius`. The arc stars from angle `from` and ends at angle `to`. The direction
of drawing `cw` is either clockwise (`cw` is *true*) or counter-clockwise (`cw`
is *false*). Coordinates and radius are measured in pixels, angles are measured
in degrees. If the angles are not provided, a full circle is generated. In HTML `center` can be split into individual parameters `x` and `y`.

#### Examples:
{: .lh-0 .mb-0 pb-0 }
```html
HTML:
<arc center="10,0" radius="5">
<arc x="10" y="0" radius="5" from="0" to="180" ccw>
```
```js
JS:
arc( 10, 0, 5);
arc( 10, 0, 5, 0, 180, false);
```

In HTML the direction of drawing is set by attribute `cw` or its antagonistic
attribute `ccw`. Their values are either *true* or *false*. If any of the
attributes is present, but has no value, it is assumed to be *true*. The
following commands are equivalent:

```html
HTML:
<arc x="10" y="0" radius="5" cw>
<arc x="10" y="0" radius="5" cw="true">
<arc x="10" y="0" radius="5" ccw="false">
```

In JS the direction of drawing is set only by `cw` and by default it is *true*.
