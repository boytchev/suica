# Suica Drawings

Suica drawings are 2D images generated in Suica (instead of being loaded from
JPEG or PNG files) that can be stamped onto 2D and 3D objects as [textures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping).
Suica drawings are based on [Canvas2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D).
