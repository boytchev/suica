# Paths

Suica drawings are based on [Canvas2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)
and they are made of stroked lines and filled areas. A virtual pen defines a
path on the canvas. This path can be *stroked* by drawing a line over it; or its
contents can be *filled* with a color.

The coordinate system of a drawing canvas has origin (0,0) at the bottom left
side of the canvas. The X axis extends to the right, Y extends to the top.

The commands to generate paths are:

- [moveTo](moveto.md) &ndash; sets the position of the virtual pen
- [lineTo](lineto.md) &ndash; adds a line segment to the path
- [curveTo](curveto.md) &ndash; adds a curved segment to the path
- [arc](arc.md) &ndash; adds a circle Ð¾r a circular arc to the path
