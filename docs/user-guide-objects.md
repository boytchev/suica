## Creating an object

In Suica object may be created as HTML tag or via JavaScript function. Each object has properties, however, they are all optional. In HTML the properties are provided as tag attributes in no specific order. In JavaScript the properties are provided as function parameters and the order is fixed.

```html
HTML:
<𝘰𝘣𝘫𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘕𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘺𝘕𝘢𝘮𝘦="𝘷𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘦" 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘺𝘕𝘢𝘮𝘦="𝘷𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘦" ...>
```
```js
JS:
𝘰𝘣𝘫𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘕𝘢𝘮𝘦( 𝘷𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘦, 𝘷𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘦, ...);
```

The following examples show the same 3D scene created in HTML and in JavaScript.

[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/object-js.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/object-js.html)

Most Suica objects share the same basic properties for [position](#position), [orientation](#orientation),
[size](#size), [color](#color) and so on. Some objects have specific properties. Properties related to events are described in chapter [Suica events](user-guide-events).

### Objects and variables

Suica keeps track of all created objects. They are created as JavaScript variables and stored in an internal Suica list of objects. When an object is created with a name, this object is also created as a global JavaScript variable. This allows to reuse or to reference the object later on.

#### id
```html
HTML:
<𝘰𝘣𝘫𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘕𝘢𝘮𝘦 id="𝘷𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘕𝘢𝘮𝘦">
```
```js
JS:
𝘷𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘕𝘢𝘮𝘦 = 𝘰𝘣𝘫𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘕𝘢𝘮𝘦( ... );
```

In HTML the name of an object is set in the `id` attribute. In JavaScript the name of an object is set by using the JavaScript way of creating variable.

```html
HTML:
<point id="p" center="25,0,15">
```
```js
JS:
p = point( [25,0,15] );
```









## Common 2D objects

The common 2D objects represents flat 1D and 2D shapes, like points, squares,
circles and so on. Their constructions requires to set just a few properties.
Some of the objects have framed variants, where only their edges are drawn with
lines.

_**Note:** The width of the lines is 1 pixel and this limitation is set in the
underlying technology._


### Point

Object. Represents a point. Its properties are `center` (or `x`, `y` and `z`),
`size`, `color`, `image`, `images` and `clone`. By default a point is drawn as a small cirlce, but
it can be changed with custom [drawing](#images-and-drawings).

```html
HTML:
<point center="25,0,15">
<point center="25,0,15" size="10" color="crimson">
```
```js
JS:
point( [25,0,15] );
point( [25,0,15], 10, 'crimson' );
```

[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/point.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/point.html)&emsp;[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/point-cloud.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/point-cloud.html)


### Line

Object. Represents a straight segment. Its properties are `center` (or `from`),
`to`, `color`, `image`, `images` and `clone`. The properties `center` and `from` are synonyms and
they set the starting point of the segment, while `to` sets the ending point. By
default a line is drawn as a solid line, but it can be changed with custom
[drawing](#images-and-drawings).

```html
HTML:
<line center="25,0,15" to="100,-20,35">
<line from="25,0,15" to="100,-20,35">
```
```js
JS:
line( [25,0,15], [100,-20,35] );
point( [25,0,15], [100,-20,35], 'red' );
```

[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/line.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/line.html)

_**Note**: Lines have no properties x, y, z, size, width, height and depth._


### Square

Object. Represents a regular square or a rectangle. Its properties are
`center` (or `x`, `y` and `z`), `size` (or `width` and `height`), `color`, `spin`, 
`wireframe`, `image`, `images` and `clone`. 

```html
HTML:

JS:
square( [25,0,15] );
square( [0,0,0], 10, 'crimson' );
```

<circle size="10" color="crimson">
```
```js
JS:
circle( [25,0,15] );
circle( [0,0,0], 10, 'crimson' );
```

[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/circle.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/circle.html)
[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/circle-ellipse.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/circle-ellipse.html)



### Polygon

Object. Represents a regular polygon or an elliptical polygon. Its properties
are `count`, `center` (or `x`, `y` and `z`), `size` (or `width` and `height`),
`color`, `spin`, `wireframe`, `image`, `images` and `clone`. The property `count` defines
the number of sides of the polygon.

```html
HTML:
<polygon count="3" center="25,0,15">
<polygon count="5" size="10" color="crimson">
```
```js
JS:
polygon( 3, [25,0,15] ); // triangle
polygon( 5, [0,0,0], 10, 'crimson' ); // pentagon
```

[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/polygon.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/polygon.html)

_**Note:** Properties size, width and height refer to the polygon circumscribed
circle, rather than the polygon itself._




## Common 3D objects

The common 3D objects represents shapes, like cubes, spheres, and so on. Their
constructions requires to set just a few properties. Some of the objects have
framed variants, where only their edges are drawn with lines.

_**Note:** The width of the lines is 1 pixel and this limitation is set in the
underlying technology._

# Advanced objects

The advanced objects are constructed from other objects. They provide more complex shapes.


## Group

Object. Represents a collection of objects grouped into a single object. A group
can be positioned, scaled, rotated and colored as other objects. Its properties
are `center` (or `x`, `y` and `z`), `size` (or `width`, `height` and `depth`),
`color`, `spin` and `clone`; it has method `add`.

```html
HTML:
<group center="0,-10,0">
   <sphere y="25" size="10">
   <cone size="12,25">
</group>
```
```js
JS:
group(
   sphere( [0,25,0], 10 ),
   cone( [0,0,0], [12,25] )
);
```

[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/group.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/group.html)
[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/group-tag.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/group-tag.html)

A group is a special objects, and some aspects of group management are:
- A group has own center, size and spin. Values of `size` of a group are scale
factors, not sizes. Centers and spins of objects in a group are relative to the
group's center and spin.
- Group objects are defined between `<group>` and `</group>` tags or as
parameters to `group(...)`. A group can be extended with new objects with
`add(...)`.
- Cloning a group will also clone all its objects, setting `color` of a group
sets it to all its objects overwriting their individual colors.



### Tube

Object. Represents a tubular object along a straight or a curved line. Its
properties are `center` (or `x`, `y` and `z`), `curve`, `radius`, `count`,
`size` (or `width`, `height` and `depth`), `color`, `spin` and `clone`. Tubes
can also model [solids of revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution), also known as lathe shapes.

<img src="images/tube.png">

The curve is a [spline](#spline) function but can also be an array of points or
user-defined function *f(u)* on which spline is automatically constructed:

```html
HTML:
<tube curve="knot" radius="4" count="300">
```
```js
JS:
tube( [0,0,0], [[50,0,0], [-50,0,0]], 5, 2 );
```

[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/tube.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/tube.html)
[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/tube-lathe.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/tube-lathe.html)
[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/tube-html.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/tube-html.html)


The `radius` of a tube is the third parameter. It is used in case there is no
radius encoded in the spline curve itself:

- if the spline points are 3D, then the *radius* parameter is used as a constant radius of the whole tube

```js
JS:
function curve3D( u )
{
   return [
      10*u, // x
      0,    // y
      0     // z
	];
}
tube( [0,0,0], curve3D, 5 ); // radius=5, taken from tube
```

- if the spline points are 4D, then the 4th coordinate is used as radius and the *radius* parameter is ignored

```js
JS:
function curve4D( u )
{
   return [
      10*u, // x
      0,    // y
      0,    // z
      1     // radius
	];
}
tube( [0,0,0], curve4D, 5 ); // radius=1, taken from curve4D
```


The *count* parameter defines the granularity of the tube. It is either a number
for the number of segments along the tube (i.e. tubular segments) or an array of
two numbers for the number of tubural and radial segments. Higher number of
segments results in smoother curve, but takes more memory space and processing
time. By default the tubural segments are 60 and the radial segments are 20.

<img src="images/tube-segments.png">

The tube adheres to the other properties of splines &ndash; whether they are
open or closed; and interpolating or approximating.

[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/tube-open-closed.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/tube-open-closed.html)
[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/tube-variations.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/tube-variations.html)

[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/tube-spline.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/tube-spline.html)
[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/tube-spline-explicit.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/tube-spline-explicit.html)

Tubes allow dynamic change of their curve and curve radius. This is performance
intensive operation, as it recalculates all vertices of the tube. Recalculation
is done whenever the *curve* or *radius* property of a tube is assigned a value.

```js
JS:
spiral = tube( [0,0,0], curve, 1 );
		
suica.ontime = function( t )
{
   spiral.radius = 3+2.8*Math.sin(4*t);
}
```

[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/tube-dynamic.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/tube-dynamic.html)


#### Clone

Readonly property. Generates a clone of the object. Whenever the value of `clone`
is retrieved, it is a clone of the object. Cloning is used to generate objects
from a single object-template.

```html
HTML:
<cube id="a" size="15">
<clone id="b" src="a">
```
```js
JS:
a = cube( [0,0,0], 25 );
b = a.clone;
```

[<kbd><img src="../examples/snapshots/clone-tag.jpg" width="300"></kbd>](../examples/clone-tag.html)

_**Note**: Cloning an object [group](#group) also clones all its objects._
