[**Suica.js**](https://github.com/boytchev/suica) is a library for easy
programming of mobile 3D graphics in JavaScript. Suica 2.0, which is currently
**under heavy but rapid development**, is based on [Three.js](https://threejs.org).
Suica is used in several undergraduate courses in the
[Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en) at
[Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng).
