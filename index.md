...as simple, as this [live demo](https://boytchev.github.io/suica/examples/minimal-example.html):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<script src="suica.js"></script>

[**Suica.js**](https://github.com/boytchev/suica) is a library for easy
programming of mobile 3D graphics in JavaScript. Suica 2.0, which is currently
**under heavy but rapid development**, is based on [Three.js](https://threejs.org).
Suica is used in several undergraduate courses in the
[Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en) at
[Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng).
